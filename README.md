# react-starter-kit

This is a React Starter Kit to get you started working with React.

It uses Babel and Webpack to bundle your app, and it's ES2015 ready.

Installation instructins

1. If you haven't already installed Webpack, run: ```npm install -g webpack```
2. Install all required node modules with: ```npm install```
3. And finally start Webpack with: ```webpack -w```. The ```-w``` argument tells Webpack to listen on file change and make a new bundle.
